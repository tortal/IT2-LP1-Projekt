 * Puzzle game
 *

 * to fill ones' individual slot puzzle. Moreover, every player has an inventory
 * of shapes, the union of all players' inventory contain all shapes needed to
 * fully fill the missing slots.
 * 
 * When beginning the game, you might have to trade shapes without fellow team
 * players until you will be able to solve YOUR puzzle.
